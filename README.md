# Capture One Film Styles
Film Styles for Phase One Capture One. 
Originally the styles are made for Lightroom and got converted. Due the fact that Capture One and Lightroom process files differently, the result is not as accurate as in Lightroom but it gives a good starting point for further tuning.

## Installation
Execute the MSI installer (build with Wix Toolset) and the styles are copied into the default Capture One Directory: `c:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\CaptureOne\Styles50`.

Have fun.
